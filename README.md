# MIPS-Optimized-Finding-Waldo-

Showing the benefits of loop unrolling and proper memory management (to increase cache hit rate) in a image processing project.

This project is designed to find waldo's face (given as pixel data) in another image, and turn it green to show that he was found. It was done twice, first nievely and secondly in a way that attempted to optimize for cache use. There are further optizations that could be done.
